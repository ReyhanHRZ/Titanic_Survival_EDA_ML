# Titanic Survival Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival. Through a step-by-step process, we conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), handled missing values, visualized key features, and performed statistical hypothesis testing. Our goal is to gain insights and optionally build predictive models.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure
- `data/`: Titanic dataset files (`train.csv`, `test.csv`, etc.).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for EDA, feature engineering, and testing.
- `scripts/`: Standalone Python scripts for visualization and analysis.
- `README.md`: Project documentation and instructions.

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: 
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `scipy`

Install all dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt



🚶 Steps Followed

    Loaded and explored the dataset.

    Identified and handled missing values.

    Performed initial data visualizations.

    Re-evaluated and re-visualized features after data cleaning.

    Conducted hypothesis testing and extracted statistical insights.

    (Optional) Built predictive models (e.g., logistic regression).

    Documented all findings for future use and reference.

▶️ How to Run

    Clone the repository.

    Navigate to the notebooks/ directory.

    Open eda_and_analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

    Follow each cell sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
